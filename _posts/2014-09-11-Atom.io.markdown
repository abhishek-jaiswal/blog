<p>
GitHub recently Launched a new text editor/ ide based on node js
<a href="https://atom.io/"><h2>Atom.io</h2></a>
A tool you can customize to do anything, but also use productively on the first
day without ever touching a config file. Atom is modern, approachable,
and hackable to the core.
<br/>
</p>


* Atom is a desktop application based on web technologies [native web technologies]


* Node.js support makes it trivial to access the file system, spawn subprocesses
[node.js integration]


* Atom is composed of over 50 open-source packages that integrate around a minimal core
[Modular Design]


* No one wants to waste time configuring their editor before they can start using it
[Full featured right aout of the box]


* It comes with apm [Atom Package Manager] [apm]

### Atom.io Installation in Ubuntu (32bit + 64bit) via PPA


*Before installing Atom, remember that it's still in beta so you may find
bugs or missing / incomplete features!*

*To install Atom in Ubuntu 14.10, 14.04 or 12.04 and derivatives
(Linux Mint, elementary OS, etc.), use the following commands:*

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install atom

If you encounter Node.js related bugs, I recommend using [THIS] [nodejs] Nodejs PPA.

**Ubuntu 13.10 users: the Unity global menu doesn't work for Atom and for this
reason, I've disabled it in the Atom builds for Saucy. If it still doesn't work
for you, please report a bug @ [GitHub] [atom-issue].**
